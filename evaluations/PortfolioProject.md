# End-to-End Machine Learning Portfolio Project  

## **Project Overview**  
This project will help you go through the development of a **simple end-to-end Machine Learning project** using the skills learned in the **Data & ML Fundamentals** trimester. The goal is to apply concepts from **data collection, processing, modeling, and evaluation** in a structured way.  

## **Project Requirements**  
Your project should include the following key phases:  

---

### **1. Problem Definition**  
- Clearly define the **problem statement** (e.g., predicting house prices, detecting fraud, customer segmentation).  
- Specify whether it is a **classification or regression problem**.  
- Justify why this problem is important.  

---

### **2. Data Collection & Preparation**  
- Collect data from one of the following sources:  
  - Ready-made datasets (e.g., Kaggle, UCI ML Repository).  
  - APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, financial data APIs).  
  - SQL or NoSQL databases.  
  - Data scraped or generated from Pandas.  
- Perform **data cleaning**:  
  - Handle missing values.  
  - Remove duplicates and inconsistencies.  
  - Convert categorical data if necessary.  
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**:  
  - Generate summary statistics.  
  - Visualize key trends and distributions.  
  - Identify correlations between features.  

---

### **3. Feature Engineering & Selection**  
- Apply transformations such as:  
  - Normalization/Standardization (if needed).  
  - Encoding categorical variables.  
  - Feature selection methods (e.g., removing low-variance features).  

---

### **4. Model Selection & Training**  
- Use **at least one of the following classical ML models**:  
  - **Decision Tree**  
  - **Linear Regression** (for regression tasks)  
  - **Logistic Regression** (for classification tasks)  
  - **Random Forest**  
  - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**  
- Split data into **training and testing sets**.  
- Train and tune hyperparameters using cross-validation.  

---

### **5. Model Evaluation**  
- Use **appropriate evaluation metrics**:  
  - **For classification**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix.  
  - **For regression**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ² Score.  
- Compare performance of different models if applicable.  
- Explain findings and limitations.  

---


### **6. Report & Documentation**  
- Summarize the project in a **structured README**:  
  - Problem statement  
  - Data source and processing steps  
  - Model selection and evaluation results  
  - Challenges faced and next steps  
- Include well-commented **code and visualizations**.  

---

### **Submission Guidelines**  
- Submit your **Jupyter Notebook / Python scripts**.  
- Ensure code is well-documented and structured.  
- Provide sample input-output for model predictions.  

---

### **Bonus (For Extra Learning)**  
- Experiment with **feature importance analysis**.  
- Compare different models and justify choices.  
- Test your model with **real-world data updates**.

This project will **demonstrate your ability to build, evaluate, and document an ML solution**, strengthening your portfolio and practical experience.
