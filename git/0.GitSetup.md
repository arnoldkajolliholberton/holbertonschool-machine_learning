# First-Time Git Setup Tutorial  

This tutorial will guide you through setting up Git for the first time on your machine, including generating a classic GitHub token for secure authentication, configuring your username and email, and cloning a repository using the token. 

We will assume you're using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as your code editor and a Linux command line for your terminal.

### **Why is Git Setup Important?**  
Setting up Git correctly is essential for managing your code, especially when working with remote repositories like GitHub. Git tracks changes, allows collaboration, and ensures that your work is organized and versioned. A properly configured Git environment with your username and email ensures your contributions are attributed correctly. Using a GitHub token for authentication ensures secure communication between your local Git setup and GitHub, replacing the need for passwords.

### **Step 1: Generate a GitHub Token**  

GitHub no longer supports password authentication for Git operations. Instead, you need to use a **personal access token** for secure access. Follow these steps to generate a token:

1. Log in to your [GitHub account](https://github.com/).
2. In the top-right corner, click on your profile picture, then select **Settings**.
3. In the left sidebar, click **Developer settings**.
4. In the Developer settings menu, select **Personal access tokens**.
5. Click **Generate new token**.
6. Give your token a descriptive name, such as "Git setup token".
7. Select the required scopes for your token. For most common Git operations, select `repo` (full control of private repositories) and `workflow` (if you need to manage GitHub Actions).
8. Click **Generate token**.
9. **Copy the token**. This is the only time you will be able to view it. Store it safely, as you'll use it for authentication instead of a password.

### **Step 2: Configure Your Git Username and Email**  

Git uses your username and email to track your commits. It's important to set these correctly so your contributions are properly attributed.

1. Open the terminal (in VS Code, you can open the integrated terminal using `Ctrl + `).
2. Run the following commands to set your global username and email (substitute with your own details):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```

This configuration ensures that your commits are linked to your name and email address, both locally and when interacting with remote repositories. You can verify the settings using:

```bash
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
```

### **Clone a Repository Using the Token**  

Cloning a repository allows you to create a local copy of a remote repository. To authenticate with GitHub using your personal access token, follow these steps:

1. **Find the repository**: Go to the repository page on GitHub that you want to clone.
2. Click the green **Code** button, and copy the HTTPS URL.
3. In the terminal, run the following command to clone the repository, replacing `your-username`, `your-token`, and `repository-name` with your details:

```bash
git clone https://your-username:your-token@github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
```

4. This command will use your GitHub username and token for authentication. You wonâ€™t be prompted for a password because the token is included in the URL.
---

### **Step 4: Verify the Clone**  

Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the project folder:

```bash
cd repository-name
```

Now you can start working with the repository.

### **Conclusion**  

By setting up Git with your username, email, and token, you ensure a smooth workflow for managing your code and collaborating with others, especially when working on shared repositories like those on GitHub. With these steps, you're ready to start contributing to projects, whether you're working alone or with a team. Happy coding!
