# Zero Day: Prerequisites for Machine Learning Specialization

Before diving into the core concepts, ensure you have a solid understanding of the following prerequisites. This document provides an overview and links to resources that will help you get prepared.

## 1. Git and GitHub
Version control is essential for managing code and collaborating effectively.

### Topics to Learn:
- What is Git and why use it?
- Basic Git commands (init, clone, add, commit, push, pull, branch, merge)
- Using GitHub for version control and collaboration
- Cloning repositories and making pull requests

### Resources:

## 2. Linux Basic Commands
Familiarity with Linux commands is crucial for working in machine learning environments.

### Topics to Learn:
- Navigating the filesystem (cd, ls, pwd)
- File operations (cp, mv, rm, mkdir, touch)
- File permissions and ownership (chmod, chown)
- Installing software (apt, yum, pip)

## 4. Basic ML Pipeline Phases
Understanding the workflow of an ML project is essential before diving into deep learning.

### Phases:
1. **Data Collection** - Gathering relevant datasets.
2. **Data Preprocessing** - Cleaning, transforming, and normalizing data.
3. **Feature Engineering** - Selecting and extracting meaningful features.
4. **Model Selection** - Choosing a suitable algorithm or architecture.
5. **Training** - Feeding data into the model and optimizing parameters.
6. **Evaluation** - Measuring model performance with metrics.
