# Unsupervised Learning  

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that identifies patterns and structures in data without labeled outcomes. This section covers key unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.  

## Projects  

### 1. Clustering  
Clustering is a technique used to group similar data points together based on certain characteristics. It is widely used in customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and pattern recognition.  

- **[Clustering Project](./clustering)**: This project explores different clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN. It includes:  
  - Data preprocessing for clustering  
  - Implementing and comparing different clustering techniques  
  - Visualizing clusters for better insights
