# Math Concepts for Machine Learning

In this directory, we will cover key mathematical concepts essential for understanding machine learning. Currently, we have the following folders:

- [Linear Algebra](./linear_algebra): Learn the basics of linear algebra, including vectors, matrices, and their role in machine learning algorithms.  
- [Calculus](./calculus): Explore the fundamentals of calculus, including derivatives, integrals, and their applications in optimizing machine learning models.  
- [Probability](./probability): Understand the principles of probability, including distributions, statistical measures, and their use in modeling uncertainty in machine learning.

The rest of the folders, including topics like statistics, will be added in the future.
