# Math Concepts for Machine Learning

In this directory, we will cover key mathematical concepts essential for understanding machine learning. Currently, we have the following folders:

- [Linear Algebra](./linear_algebra): Learn the basics of linear algebra, including vectors, matrices, and their role in machine learning algorithms.  
- [Calculus](./calculus): Explore the fundamentals of calculus, including derivatives, integrals, and their applications in optimizing machine learning models.

The rest of the folders, including topics like probability and statistics, will be added in the future.
