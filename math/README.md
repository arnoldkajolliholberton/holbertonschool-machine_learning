# Math Concepts for Machine Learning

In this directory, we will cover key mathematical concepts essential for understanding machine learning. Currently, we have the following folder:

- [Linear Algebra](./linear_algebra): Learn the basics of linear algebra, including vectors, matrices, and their role in machine learning algorithms.

The rest of the folders, including topics like probability and statistics, and calculus, will be added in the future.
