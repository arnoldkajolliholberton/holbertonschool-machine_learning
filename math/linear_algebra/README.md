# Linear Algebra for Machine Learning

This folder covers essential linear algebra concepts used in machine learning. Understanding these principles is crucial for grasping machine learning algorithms and their implementations.

### Vectors and Matrices  
A **vector** is a one-dimensional array, and a **matrix** is a two-dimensional array. These are fundamental structures for machine learning algorithms. The **transpose** of a matrix is obtained by swapping its rows and columns, which plays a key role in many linear algebra operations.

### Shape, Axis, and Slicing  
The **shape** of a matrix refers to its dimensions (rows and columns), and **axes** define the direction along which operations are applied (rows or columns). **Slicing** allows you to extract specific portions of vectors or matrices, enabling you to work with subsets of data.

### Operations and Concatenation  
In linear algebra, **element-wise operations** (like addition and multiplication) are applied to each element individually in vectors and matrices. You can also **concatenate** vectors or matrices, joining them along a specific axis to create larger data structures.

### Dot Product and Matrix Multiplication  
The **dot product** is a scalar value derived from two vectors, while **matrix multiplication** involves multiplying rows of one matrix with columns of another. These operations are fundamental to many machine learning algorithms.

### NumPy and Broadcasting  
**NumPy** is a Python library that provides efficient tools for working with vectors and matrices. It also supports **broadcasting**, a technique that allows operations on arrays of different shapes by automatically adjusting the smaller array to match the larger one.

### Parallelization  
**Parallelization** involves running multiple operations simultaneously, which speeds up computationsâ€”critical for handling large datasets and improving the performance of machine learning models.
