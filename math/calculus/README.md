# Calculus for Machine Learning

This project explores key calculus concepts essential for understanding and implementing machine learning algorithms. Calculus is at the heart of optimization techniques, which are fundamental in training models.

### Topics Covered  

#### Notation and Series  
- **Summation and Product Notation**: Compact ways to represent the addition or multiplication of terms, commonly used in loss functions and model updates.  
- **Series**: Understanding finite and infinite series, including common series often encountered in mathematical modeling.

#### Derivatives  
- **What is a Derivative?**: The rate of change of a function, crucial for optimization in machine learning.  
- **Product and Chain Rules**: Methods for finding derivatives of complex functions.  
- **Common Derivative Rules**: Quick computation techniques for standard functions like polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms.  
- **Partial Derivatives**: Understanding gradients, which are used in multivariable optimization problems.

#### Integrals  
- **Indefinite and Definite Integrals**: Techniques for finding areas under curves, often used in probabilistic models.  
- **Double Integrals**: Applications in working with functions over two-dimensional spaces.
