# Probability for Machine Learning

This project focuses on fundamental probability concepts, which are essential for understanding data uncertainty and building machine learning models.

### Topics Covered  

#### Basics of Probability  
- **What is Probability?**: Understanding the likelihood of events and how to quantify uncertainty.  
- **Notation and Rules**: Key symbols and the general addition and multiplication rules for probabilities.  
- **Independence and Disjoint Events**: Differences between events that do not influence each other and those that cannot occur simultaneously.  
- **Union and Intersection**: Understanding combined events and overlaps between events.

#### Probability Distributions  
- **Probability Distribution**: Describes how probabilities are assigned to different outcomes.  
- **Probability Mass and Density Functions**: Tools for working with discrete and continuous random variables, respectively.  
- **Cumulative Distribution Function**: Represents the probability of a random variable being less than or equal to a certain value.

#### Statistical Measures  
- **Percentile**: A value below which a given percentage of data falls.  
- **Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation**: Key measures of central tendency and data spread.

#### Common Probability Distributions  
Exploration of frequently used distributions such as binomial, normal, and uniform distributions, and their applications in machine learning.
