## 1. Introduction to Machine Learning Concepts

### What is a Model?
A model is a mathematical representation of a real-world process used to make predictions based on input data.

### What is Supervised Learning?
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model learns from labeled data, meaning each input has a corresponding correct output.

### What is a Prediction?
A prediction is the output generated by a model when it processes new input data based on learned patterns.

### What is a Node?
A node (or neuron) is a basic unit in a neural network that takes inputs, applies a function, and passes the output to the next layer.

### What is a Weight?
A weight is a parameter that determines how much influence an input has on a node’s output.

### What is a Bias?
A bias is an additional parameter in a node that shifts the output, helping the model learn better representations.

### What is a Layer?
A layer consists of multiple nodes that process input data and pass results to the next layer.

### What is a Hidden Layer?
A hidden layer is any layer between the input and output layers, allowing the model to learn complex representations.

## 3. Activation Functions

Activation functions define the output of a node given an input, introducing non-linearity into the model.

### Sigmoid Function
The sigmoid function outputs values between 0 and 1, making it useful for binary classification.
\[ \sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \]

### Tanh Function
The tanh function outputs values between -1 and 1, often used in hidden layers.
\[ \tanh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}} \]

### ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
The ReLU function outputs zero for negative values and the input itself for positive values.
\[ f(x) = \max(0, x) \]

### Softmax Function
The softmax function converts logits (raw model outputs) into probabilities that sum to 1, used for multi-class classification.
\[ \sigma(z)_i = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j} e^{z_j}} \]

## 4. Logistic Regression and Classification

### What is Logistic Regression?
Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm that uses the sigmoid function to predict binary outcomes.

### What is Multiclass Classification?
Multiclass classification involves categorizing inputs into more than two distinct classes using methods like softmax activation.

### What is a One-Hot Vector?
A one-hot vector is a binary representation of categorical data, where only one element is 1, and the rest are 0.

### How to Encode/Decode One-Hot Vectors
- **Encoding**: Convert categorical labels into one-hot vectors.
- **Decoding**: Convert a one-hot vector back into a categorical label.

## 5. Training a Neural Network

### What is Forward Propagation?
Forward propagation is the process of passing input data through the network layer by layer to generate predictions.

### What is a Loss Function?
A loss function measures how far the model’s predictions are from the actual values.

### What is Cross-Entropy Loss?
Cross-entropy loss is used in classification tasks to measure the difference between the predicted probability distribution and the true labels.
\[ L = -\sum_{i} y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) \]

### What is a Cost Function?
A cost function aggregates the loss function over all training examples.

### What is Gradient Descent?
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that adjusts weights and biases to minimize the cost function.

### What is Backpropagation?
Backpropagation is the process of computing gradients of the cost function with respect to the weights, used to update the network during training.

### What is a Computation Graph?
A computation graph is a visual representation of the operations and data flow in a neural network, useful for understanding forward and backward passes.

### How to Initialize Weights/Biases
- **Random Initialization**: Prevents all nodes from learning the same thing.
- **Zero Initialization**: Not recommended as it leads to symmetry problems.
- **He or Xavier Initialization**: Used to improve convergence in deep networks.

### Importance of Vectorization
Vectorization speeds up computations by using matrix operations instead of loops, leveraging hardware acceleration.

## 6. Data Handling and Preprocessing

### How to Split Up Your Data
- **Training Set**: Used to train the model.
- **Validation Set**: Used to tune hyperparameters.
- **Test Set**: Used to evaluate the final model’s performance.

### What is Pickling in Python?
Pickling is a method of serializing and saving Python objects (like models and datasets) for later use.
