# Supervised Learning  

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where models learn from labeled data to make predictions. It is widely used in applications such as classification, regression, and forecasting.  

## Projects  

### 1. Classification  
Classification is the task of predicting a category or label for given input data. This project focuses on building neural networks from scratch to perform classification tasks.  

- **[Classification Project](./classification)**: This project gradually builds a neural network step by step:  
  - **Neuron**: Implementing a single artificial neuron with forward and backward propagation.  
  - **Neural Network**: Extending to a simple feedforward neural network with multiple neurons and layers.  
  - **Deep Neural Network**: Implementing a deep learning model with multiple hidden layers for complex classification tasks.
