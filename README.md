# Holberton School Machine Learning Training

Welcome to the Holberton School Machine Learning Training repository! This 9-month program is designed to provide a comprehensive and practical understanding of machine learning, structured into three distinct trimesters:

### 1. Data Analysis and Foundational Machine Learning  
Focuses on building a solid foundation in data analysis, statistics, and introductory machine learning techniques. You will learn how to preprocess data, implement basic algorithms, and evaluate models effectively.

### 2. Advanced Machine Learning and Deep Learning  
Explores more complex machine learning algorithms, deep learning models, and frameworks. Topics include neural networks, natural language processing, and computer vision.

### 3. Machine Learning Engineering  
Concentrates on deploying and scaling machine learning systems in production environments. You will learn best practices for model optimization, pipeline development, and integration into real-world applications.

## Repository Structure  
The repository is organized into directories, each corresponding to a specific aspect of the program.  
You can navigate to individual folders for detailed content.

- [Git](./git): Resources and exercises to build proficiency in version control using Git.  
- [Math](./math): Key mathematical concepts related to machine learning training, including linear algebra, probability and statistics, and calculus. This section will cover the foundational math you need to understand machine learning algorithms deeply.  
- [Pipeline](./pipeline): Tools and techniques for building machine learning workflows. Currently includes Pandas for data preprocessing.

Additional directories will be added as the program progresses.
