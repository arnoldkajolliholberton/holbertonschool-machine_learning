# Pipeline for Machine Learning

The **Pipeline** folder focuses on tools and techniques for building effective machine learning workflows. These tools are essential for transforming raw data into a format ready for model training and evaluation.

### Current Contents  
- [Pandas](./pandas): Learn how to manipulate and analyze data using Pandas, a key library for data preprocessing in machine learning.
- [APIs](./apis): Explore methods to retrieve and process data from various APIs. This section covers interacting with external APIs to acquire datasets that can be integrated into machine learning workflows.  

### Future Additions  
This folder will be expanded to include other components of the machine learning pipeline, such as data visualization, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
