## End-to-End Deep Learning Project: Fashion MNIST (Image Classification)

This guide walks you through building an end-to-end deep learning project using the **Fashion MNIST** dataset. It’s a **multi-class image classification** task where the goal is to identify clothing items (e.g., shirts, shoes, bags) from grayscale `28x28` pixel images.

The project covers every stage from loading and exploring the data to saving the trained model and testing it again after reloading — giving students hands-on experience with a full deep learning workflow.

### **Phase 1: Data Loading & Exploration**
**Goal**: Understand the dataset  
**Tasks**:
- Load data using `tensorflow.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist`
- Visualize sample images and labels  
- Check class distribution  

**Questions**:
- What are the input dimensions?
- Are the classes balanced?
- Do I need to normalize the data?

---

### **Phase 2: Preprocessing**
**Goal**: Prepare data for training  
**Tasks**:
- Normalize pixel values (e.g., divide by 255)
- One-hot encode labels (if using `categorical_crossentropy`)
- Split train/validation sets if needed  

**Questions**:
- Is my data in the right shape and format?

### **Phase 3: Model Design**
**Goal**: Build a suitable neural network  
**Tasks**:
- Use `Sequential()` or functional API
- Add input layer, hidden layers (e.g., Dense), output layer
- Choose activation functions (e.g., ReLU, softmax)

**Questions**:
- Is my model too simple or too complex?
- Do I need regularization (Dropout)?

---

###  **Phase 4: Training**
**Goal**: Fit the model to training data  
**Tasks**:
- Compile model (optimizer, loss, metrics)
- Train with `model.fit()`, include validation data
- Use callbacks (e.g., EarlyStopping)

**Questions**:
- Is my model underfitting or overfitting?
- Do I need to adjust learning rate, batch size, or epochs?

---

### **Phase 5: Evaluation & Testing**
**Goal**: Measure performance and test generalization  
**Tasks**:
- Evaluate on test data using `model.evaluate()`
- Generate confusion matrix 

**Questions**:
- What's the accuracy? Any class-specific weaknesses?

---

### **Phase 6: Saving & Loading the Model**
**Goal**: Preserve and reuse the trained model  
**Tasks**:
- Save model: `model.save('model.h5')` or `model.save('model.keras')`
- Load model
- Predict on new/unseen data

**Questions**:
- Can I successfully reload and use the saved model?
- Does the saved model produce the same results?
