# Portfolio Projects   

This section contains engaging and educational projects designed to build skills in programming, mathematics, data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning. The projects are divided into thematic categories, focusing on different areas of learning.  

Each project combines fun, practical tasks with foundational concepts to help you develop both technical and analytical abilities.

## **Key Goals**  
1. **Learn by Doing**: Reinforce your understanding of topics like probability, randomness, and visualization through hands-on practice.  
2. **Explore Real-World Applications**: Apply programming to simulate games, analyze data, and visualize patterns.  
3. **Build a Portfolio**: Create structured, well-documented projects to showcase your skills.

## **Project Categories**  

### 1. **Mathematics and Probability**  
Explore the world of randomness and probability through fun simulations and games! Projects in this category include:  
- **[Dice Roll Statistics](math_projects/DiceRoll.md)**: Simulate dice rolls, analyze outcomes, and visualize probabilities.  
- **[Random Walker in a Grid](math_projects/RandomWalker.md)**: Create a 2D random walk, visualize paths, and analyze movement behavior.  
- **[Rock-Paper-Scissors Simulator](math_projects/RockPaperScissor.md)**: Compete against a **random** AI, track outcomes, and explore conditional probabilities.  

#### **Hints for Success**  
- Familiarize yourself with **Numpy** for random number generation and array operations.  
- Use **Matplotlib** to showcase your results through plots and charts.  
- Reflect on the results: How do they compare to theoretical expectations?  

### 2. **(Other Categories Placeholder)**  
This repository will grow to include projects in additional areas like:  
- Machine Learning  
- Data Visualization  
- Simulation and Modeling
