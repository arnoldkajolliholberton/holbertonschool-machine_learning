## **Project Categories**  

### 1. **Mathematics and Probability**  
Explore the world of randomness and probability through fun simulations and games! Projects in this category include:  
- **[Dice Roll Statistics](math_projects/DiceRoll.md)**: Simulate dice rolls, analyze outcomes, and visualize probabilities.  
- **[Random Walker in a Grid](math_projects/RandomWalker.md)**: Create a 2D random walk, visualize paths, and analyze movement behavior.  
- **[Rock-Paper-Scissors Simulator](math_projects/RockPaperScissor.md)**: Compete against a **random** AI, track outcomes, and explore conditional probabilities.  

### 2. **Supervised Learning**  
Practical hands-on machine learning projects that demonstrate the supervised learning techniques. Projects in this category include:  
- **[Simple End-to-End ML Flow with IRIS Dataset](supervised_learning/End%20to%20End%20ML%20Workflow.ipynb)**: Implement a basic machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, using the classic IRIS dataset.  
- **[Classification of Wisconsin Dataset](supervised_learning/Complete%20Classification%20Wisconsin.ipynb)**: Build and evaluate a classification model to predict breast cancer diagnosis using the Wisconsin dataset.  
- **[Regression of California Housing Dataset](supervised_learning/Price%20Prediction%20Analysis%20using%20California%20Housing%20Dataset.ipynb)**: Develop a regression model to predict housing prices using the California housing dataset, showcasing feature engineering and model evaluation.
