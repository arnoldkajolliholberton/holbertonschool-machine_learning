## Dice Roll Statistics

#### **Project Description**  
In this project, you will simulate rolling a fair 6-sided die multiple times using **Numpy** for random number generation. The goal is to track the frequency of each outcome, calculate basic statistics such as probabilities, and compare the results to the theoretical probabilities of a fair die. The project reinforces the use of random functions, basic probability, and data visualization.

#### **Learning Objectives**  
- Use **Numpy** to simulate repeated random events (dice rolls).  
- Apply concepts of probability to analyze frequency distributions.  
- Visualize data and statistics using **Matplotlib**.  
- Compare simulated probabilities with theoretical expectations.

### **Project Requirements**  

1. **Simulation Setup**  
   - Simulate rolling a standard 6-sided die (with faces numbered `1` to `6`) multiple times (e.g., `1000 rolls`).
   - Use **Numpy** to generate random numbers corresponding to dice outcomes.  

2. **Tracking Outcomes**  
   - Keep track of how often each number appears during the simulation.  
   - Calculate the **frequency** of each outcome.  
   - Convert these frequencies into **probabilities** for comparison.

3. **Theoretical Probabilities**  
   - Recall that the theoretical probability for each face of a fair 6-sided die is `1/6`.  
   - Compare your simulated probabilities to the theoretical value.

4. **Visualization**  
   - Create a bar chart showing:  
     - The **frequencies** of each dice outcome.  
     - The **simulated probabilities** of each outcome.  
     - Include markers for the **theoretical probability** of `1/6`.

5. **Statistics**  
   - Calculate and display the **mean** and **variance** of the dice rolls.  
   - Analyze whether the simulated results align with expectations for a fair die.

6. **Stretch Goals (Optional)**  
   - Simulate rolling a weighted (biased) die where some numbers are more likely to appear than others, and observe the changes in frequencies and probabilities.  
   - Increase the number of rolls (e.g., `10,000`) and analyze whether the simulated probabilities converge closer to the theoretical values.  
   - Run multiple trials (e.g., `100 simulations of 1000 rolls each`) and visualize the distribution of frequencies for each face across trials.
